//! Mechanism Weight Manager
//!
//! Groups weights from multiple challenges by mechanism_id for batch submission to Bittensor.
//! Each challenge is mapped to a mechanism (1:1 relationship).
//!
//! Weight Distribution:
//! - Each challenge has an emission_weight (0.0 - 1.0) defining its share of total emissions
//! - Challenge scores are passed through as-is (no normalization/manipulation)
//! - Remaining weight (1.0 - emission_weight) goes to UID 0 (burn address)
